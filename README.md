# Assignment2_sampling_102303331
This project focuses on credit card fraud detection using different sampling techniques and machine learning models.
Since fraud datasets are highly imbalanced, sampling plays a very important role in improving model performance.
In this project, we compare:
Multiple sampling methods
Multiple classification models
Their accuracy scores
And find the best model + sampling combination
